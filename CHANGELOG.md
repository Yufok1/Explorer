All notable changes to the Explorer project will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-26

### Added
- **Biphasic Operation**: Genesis and Sovereign phases for system evolution
- **Mathematical Capability Assessment**: Dynamic phase transitions based on understanding
- **Breath Engine**: Natural breathing patterns for system timing
- **Mirror Systems**: Self-reflection and foresight capabilities
  - Mirror of Insight: System state analysis
  - Mirror of Portent: Outcome forecasting and warnings
  - Bloom System: Natural unfolding patterns
- **Dynamic Operations**: Intelligent, adaptive operation generation
- **Sovereign Hash-Based Identifiers**: Identity = definition for perfect integrity
- **Enhanced VP Calculation**: Measures deviations from achievable ideals
- **Dynamic Stability Center**: Learns from actual performance to set realistic standards

### Changed
- **Memory Measurement**: Fixed to capture actual memory usage instead of 0.0
- **Bloom Curvature**: Implemented logarithmic scaling to prevent explosion
- **Identifier System**: Replaced UUIDs with sovereign hash-based identifiers for perfect integrity
- **Stability Standards**: Replaced impossible ideals (0ms, 0MB) with realistic, achievable values
- **Phase Transitions**: Now based on mathematical understanding rather than fixed thresholds

### Fixed
- **Memory Tracking**: Resolved issue where all functions showed 0.0MB memory usage
- **VP Inconsistency**: Fixed VP calculation showing 0.0 for some operations
- **Identifier Duplication**: Implemented proper deduplication in kernel system
- **Bloom Explosion**: Controlled growth using logarithmic scaling

- **Exception Handling**: Enhanced error reporting and recovery
- **Performance Learning**: System adapts stability center based on observed performance
- **Pattern Recognition**: Dynamic operations learn from success/failure patterns
- **Mathematical Maturity**: Comprehensive assessment across VP, stability, breath, bloom, and learning
- **Sovereign Identity**: Perfect integrity through hash-based identification
