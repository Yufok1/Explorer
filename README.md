# Explorer: Enhanced Specification Sheet

## Project Overview

Explorer is an open-source Python system for agentic, modular, and lawful governance of code modules. It is designed for transparency, diagnostics, and autonomous operation with enhanced mathematical capability assessment and dynamic stability systems.

## Technical Specifications

* **Language:** Python 3.8+
* **License:** MIT
* **Repository:** https://github.com/Yufok1/Explorer
* **Author:** Jeff Towers

## Core Capabilities

1. **Agentic Controller** (`main.py`):  
   * Orchestrates execution of modules in isolated processes.  
   * Collects telemetry: execution time (ms), memory usage (MB), reliability (success/failure).  
   * Manages checkpoints and diagnostics.
   * Implements biphasic operation (Genesis and Sovereign phases).
   * Features dynamic stability center that learns from performance.

2. **Process Isolation** (`sandbox.py`):  
   * Runs modules in separate processes for safety and measurement.  
   * Handles process termination and error reporting.

3. **Telemetry and Metrics** (`metrics.py`):  
   * Measures speed, memory, and reliability for each module run.  
   * Calculates Violation Potential (VP) for certification.
   * Implements trait-based deviation measurement from ideal values.

4. **Lawful Kernel** (`kernel.py`):  
   * Maintains system order, versioning, and rollback.  
   * Ensures only certified modules are active.
   * Prevents duplicate UUID entries.

5. **Sentinel and Diagnostics** (`sentinel.py`, `diagnostics.py`):  
   * Monitors module health and certification status.  
   * Saves checkpoints and generates diagnostic reports.
   * Implements mathematical capability assessment for phase transitions.

6. **Identity System** (`identity.py`):
   * Generates deterministic UUIDs based on performance characteristics.
   * Ensures unique identification of modules based on their traits.

7. **Breath Engine** (`breath_engine.py`):
   * Implements natural breathing patterns for system timing.
   * Provides rhythmic operation cycles.

8. **Mirror Systems** (`mirror_systems.py`):
   * Mirror of Insight: Analyzes system state and patterns.
   * Mirror of Portent: Forecasts potential outcomes and warnings.
   * Bloom System: Natural unfolding and growth patterns.

9. **Dynamic Operations** (`dynamic_operations.py`):
   * Generates intelligent, adaptive operations based on system state.
   * Implements learning patterns to prevent infinite loops.

10. **Test Modules** (`test_func1.py` to `test_func5.py`):  
    * Example Python scripts for system operation and measurement.  
    * Can be replaced with user or third-party modules.

11. **Color-Coded Output:**  
    * Uses ANSI escape codes for telemetry and status reporting.  
    * Color protocol: CRITICAL, SUCCESS, STATUS, ACTION, OBJECTIVE, INFO, MATH.

12. **Trait Translation:**  
    * Converts raw telemetry into layman-friendly labels and explanations.

13. **Diagnostics and Checkpointing:**  
    * Time-based, production-based, and startup/shutdown checkpoints.  
    * Reports saved in `data/checkpoints/`.

14. **Extensibility:**  
    * Modular architecture allows integration of new modules and functions.  
    * Open source for community contributions.

## Key Enhancements

- **Mathematical Capability Assessment**: System transitions between phases based on mathematical understanding rather than fixed thresholds.
- **Dynamic Stability Center**: Learns from actual performance to set realistic, achievable ideals.
- **Trait-Based UUID Generation**: Creates unique identifiers based on performance characteristics.
- **Breath Integration**: Natural timing patterns for system operation.
- **Bloom System**: Natural unfolding patterns with controlled growth using logarithmic scaling.
- **Enhanced VP Calculation**: Measures deviations from achievable ideals rather than impossible standards.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Python 3.8+.
3. Install dependencies:  
   ```
   pip install psutil
   ```
4. Run the system:  
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## File Structure

* `main.py` — Enhanced Controller with biphasic operation
* `identity.py` — Deterministic UUID generation
* `sandbox.py` — Process isolation
* `metrics.py` — Enhanced telemetry and VP calculation
* `kernel.py` — Lawful Kernel with duplicate prevention
* `sentinel.py` — Enhanced monitoring and mathematical capability assessment
* `diagnostics.py` — Checkpointing and reporting
* `breath_engine.py` — Natural breathing patterns
* `mirror_systems.py` — Self-reflection and foresight capabilities
* `dynamic_operations.py` — Intelligent operation generation
* `test_func1.py` to `test_func5.py` — Example modules

## Usage Notes

* Modules must have a `main()` function or entry point.
* Telemetry is collected for each run; results are color-coded and explained.
* Unstable or unlawful modules are replaced or flagged.
* Diagnostics are saved for audit and review.
* System operates in two phases: Genesis (chaos) and Sovereign (order).
* Mathematical capability assessment determines phase transitions.
